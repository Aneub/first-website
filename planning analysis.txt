Meet your Neighbors: Local supplier info

What information do I need?
Most of the facts and text will be made up. I will create the menu and the maps of locations. The local supplier info will be made up in this case but if it was a real business I would speak with the supplier and get a short story from them and write about them specifically. The pictures or graphics will come from google image searches. If it was a real business I might take my own pictures of finished drinks and fruits.

What information will your forms provide?
I will collect name, phone numer, email address and comments/suggestions

The most difficult part of the assignment: the most difficult part is coming up with creative names for the pages. I don't think my pages can all be completely generic considering the type of business and target audience. I think some can be standard but some should be creative. I came up with a couple working titles and will continue to think as I create the rest of the page
