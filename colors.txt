Colors

Fresh squeezed fruit juice: I want my site to reflect the colors and designs you might see at music festivals because that is where our target audience will mostly be coming from but I do not want to be generic. I want to use calming colored tones of purples, greens and greys with hints of orange. For lack of a better phrase I would say these are "hippie festival colors" but even so I think all these colors can represent the product of fresh squeezed fruit/vegetable  juice wile being fun but not excessive. I am looking at the following colors or variations of as options:

Warm purple B53C63, Orange ff7400, White ffffff , Forest green 387824, Dark purple/grey 402e34 , Light purple (instead of white) 9c7985 , eae2e6, Bright green 78e700, gray - #808080
